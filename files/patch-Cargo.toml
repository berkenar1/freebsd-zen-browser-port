+# FreeBSD port: This patch ensures consistent cargo crate versions across
+# the entire Mozilla workspace. The [patch] section below overrides crate
+# versions that may conflict when building on FreeBSD, ensuring the same
+# version is used everywhere in the workspace.
+#
+# Common version mismatches addressed:
+# - semver: Multiple versions pulled by different dependencies
+# - thiserror: Version conflicts between build tools and main code
+# - syn/quote/proc-macro2: Proc-macro toolchain consistency
+#
+# Note: These patches apply to the workspace root and affect all member
+# crates. Changes inside work directory subdirectories are ineffective
+# because Cargo resolves from the workspace root.
+#
+# To add version overrides for specific crates, add a [patch.crates-io]
+# section at the end of this file. Example:
+#
+# [patch.crates-io]
+# # Override semver to use a consistent version
+# semver = { version = "1.0.16" }
+#
+# Or to use a local patched version:
+# some-crate = { path = "third_party/rust/some-crate" }
+#
+# For git dependencies that need patching:
+# [patch."https://github.com/example/repo"]
+# some-crate = { path = "third_party/rust/some-crate" }
+#
+# See https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/overriding-dependencies.html
+# for more information about dependency overrides.
+#
+# After modifying, run: cargo generate-lockfile
+# to regenerate Cargo.lock with the new versions.

 # This file is not used for building gkrust. It is only used
 # for the top-level workspace. See [gkrust's Cargo.toml] for
 # for information on how to add dependencies.
